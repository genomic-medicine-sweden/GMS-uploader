FX - creating custom importers
++++++++++++++++++++++

Custom import functions (FX) are provided via a plugin system.

FX importers are created as python modules and should be put under ``<GMS-upploader install path>/fx`` .

A good start to create a new importer is to look closely at the ``analytix`` importer that is already present in the fx modules folder.
